# backend-pixel-artist

This is the backend to my 20 Squared pixel artist project which was one of my major coursework pieces on my bootcamp which ended in May 2022. The backend uses Express to access a SQL database which holds all the user details and saved user pieces of pixel artwork. Please check out the accompanying repo for details of the React front end of this project/
